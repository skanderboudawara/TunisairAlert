
'LED BOARD' and 'LED BOARD REVERSED' were created when I was working on a web graphic -- an became frustrated trying to create a scoreboard by hand and got sick of pasting layers of dots so I made this font. It will only do CAPs, but the font is mapped to respond to lower case as well. Most common American English punctuations are included

Send me an email if you like this font, have suggestions or use it on a web page (send the URL, I'd like to see it in action :).
