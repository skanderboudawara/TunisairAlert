Tunisair daily ingestion KPI
============

This tool is developed to create a daily ingest report of Tunisair flight performance. 
The report will show:
- Tunisair made how many arrival and departure delays
- The min, max, and average delays for departures and arrival
- A bar chart performance comparison between Tunisair, Nouvelair, Airfrance (& Transavia)
Once the daily report is generated, it will be published on the Twitter account [@Tunisairalert](https://twitter.com/Tunisairalert) at 9 a.m Europe/Paris timezone.
